# Cost-Effective, Open-Source Photometry for Ultra Low-Light Level Applications
Design files and assembly instructions for the CICLoPS ultrasensitive optoelectronic system for in-vivo fiber photometry system

# Background
Fiber photometry is a tool used in neuroscience to optically monitor neural correlates of behavior to targeted neuronal populations in the brain. When applied to study neurons genetically-targeted to express optical reporters of local physiological dynamics, the experimentalist gains access to real-time activity of arbitrary neuronal populations during behavioral assays. 

The technology surrounding photometry has matured rapidly, and multiple systems have been reported and several solutions are now commercially available. However, mainstream technologies have limitations, of which poor sensitivity to fluorescence is a notable challenge. This problem is compensated in experiments by increasing the level of input excitation light. However, this causes increased destruction of the fluorescent proteins, which results in a reduction in overall brightness, and largely restricts studies to short-term transients, precluding longer-term and repeated investigations into optically-reported neuronal activity. The [Integrated Circuits and Optical Imaging Laboratory](http://people.ucalgary.ca/~kmurari/index.html) at the University of Calgary developed a high-performance, cost-effective system for deep-brain optical measurements of fluorescence intensity transients in freely-moving animals that achieves excellent Signal-to-noise ratio at extremely low levels of input excitation light. The system is named CICLoPS for **C**ost-effective, ***I**n-Vivo*, **C**ustomizeable, **Lo**w-Power, **P**hotometry **S**ystem.

# Components
CICLoPS is a complete solution for in-vivo fiber photometry, designed specifically to monitor neural activity with low-light levels.
